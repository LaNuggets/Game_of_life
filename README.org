This is a simplified version of the "Game of life" by john Conway made in python.
This version have 3 rules, which are :
1. If a cell have exactly 3 living neighbors she became alive on the next turn.
2. If a cell have exactly 2 living neighbors nothing happen (dead = dead, alive = alive) on the next turn.
3. Otherwise the cell die on the next turn.
